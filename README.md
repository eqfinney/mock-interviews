## Data Munging Practice Interviews
Author: Emily Quinn Finney

A practice interview conducted using data obtained from the Kaggle Titanic data
set (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). Additional practice interviews 
with different data sets may be added in the future. 

These practice interviews are intended to be quick exploratory analyses and as
such do not contain careful testing or code design. They do, however, include several notes within the code that helped me benchmark my ease in completing
different data munging tasks.
